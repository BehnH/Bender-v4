# Bender-v4
The latest and greatest version of Bender.

## ⚠ CURRENTLY JUST A FRAMEWORK! ⚠

This rewrite is ambitious: A full rewrite using a new language and a custom library. At the moment it's in testing, but most of the hard work is done. We'll be gradually adding commands and features while overhauling the bot's efficiency and user experience.

## Translations

At the moment we don't have much to translate, but as we add features we'll be looking for people to help translate the bot so it can be used in multiple languages! If you're interested, please monitor this repo and join our [support server](https://discord.gg/99xaeGn) to let us know!

## Note about premium features

Code for most/all premium commands and features will not be open-source (at least for the time being.) We need to continue providing an incentive for users to support our work and cover server costs. We may be able to open-source these parts as well in the future, depending on the level of support we are fortunate enough to reach. :)
